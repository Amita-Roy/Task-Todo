# Task Todo (Page is not responsive)

> I have created this todoList app with 1 default project and 2 default todos in it. The whole app is built with vanilla Javascript and jquery. For styling I have used Css. In this app user can perform following actions:

- Add a new Project
- Add a new Todo in the selected project
- Edit todo details
- Delete a todo test

> Todo priority colors are different as per the priority level. All the data is getting saved in local storage and we are pulling data from the local storage.
